Collaborative erotic writing! Think of it as a big group erotic role play, but more structured, and over longer term. You might find this structure too constraining, and that's fine!

First, choose or create a character in the CHARACTERS folder. There's no real defined structure. You can make self inserts, but be aware, all characters are able to be used by all contributors. You can ask people to leave your character alone in your description, but it may not be respected.

Then, go to the SCENARIO folder and either create a new one or continue an existing one. Then, you can write to your hearts content.

You may edit other people's work, but don't rewrite it to be something else entirely. If you like the way something started, but don't like the way it continued, copy the file into a new scenario.

Nothing illegal, obviously.

Put trigger warnings at the top of scenarios (e.g. psuedo-incest, consensual non consent).
